## resteraurant visitiors prediction

### Goal

In this competition, you're challenged to use reservation and visitation data to predict the total number of visitors to a restaurant for future dates. This information will help restaurants be much more efficient and allow them to focus on creating an enjoyable dining experience for their customers.

Submissions are evaluated on the root mean squared logarithmic error.

The RMSLE is calculated as

1n∑i=1n(log(pi+1)−log(ai+1))2−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√,
1n∑i=1n(log⁡(pi+1)−log⁡(ai+1))2,
where:

nn is the total number of observations 
pipi is your prediction of visitors
aiai is the actual number of visitors 
log(x)log⁡(x) is the natural logarithm of x
